# XenoTools

This is a collection of tools to manipulate Xenogears game data. It's still a work in progress, and it's part of a project to port the Xenogears italian patch made by sadnes city (https://www.sadnescity.it/traduzioni/xeno/xeno.php) to work with the japanese edition of the cd. 

It is currently incomplete and does not work, and I'm not working on it currently.

Please note that I do not own any right on the game, nor I have anything to do with the original translation patch.
